# Astrojax-Pendulum-Simulator
This project derives differential equations for finding the equations of motion of an Astrojax pendulum symbolically and numerically solves these equations. The results would be animated. This project was inspired by problem 7 of the 2020 International Young Physicists' Tournament. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: This project is based off M. Jokar's approach.
